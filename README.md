## Who Should Use Vouchery? ##
> People who like money and want more of it.

> Before you sign up for any new product or service, search Vouchery to see if a friend has posted a referral code. Use their referral code to save money on sign-up.
> Post all your referral codes on Vouchery so that your friends can find them. When they sign up, you'll get credited.

## The Problem Vouchery Solves ##

> People often get referral codes from companies such as Uber, Lyft, Munchery, etc., but don't know who to give these referral codes to because there's no easy way to find out which friends need those codes.
> People are also constantly searching for coupons and promo codes they can use to get discounts when they first sign up for a product.
> Vouchery solves both these problems. Friends who have referral codes can post them to Vouchery, and friends who need promo codes can search Vouchery for them.
